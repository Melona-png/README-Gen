1. Initialize an empty string "readmeText" to store the generated readme content
2. Prompt the user for the project name, description, installation instructions, usage, contribution guidelines and license
3. Append the user inputs to "readmeText" in the following format:
   - Project name: as the title of the readme
   - Description: as a brief paragraph
   - Installation: as a subheading with bullet points
   - Usage: as a subheading with examples
   - Contribution: as a subheading with guidelines
   - License: as a subheading with the selected license
4. Write "readmeText" to a file named "README.md"
5. End program


TODO-
<!-- Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init and following the prompts.

Install the required dependencies by running npm install inquirer to install the inquirer package for user input.

Create a new file called generate_readme.js and open it in your text editor. -->

<!-- Require the inquirer package at the top of your script: -->
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

<!-- Initialize an empty string readmeText to store the generated README content: -->
let readmeText = '';

<!-- Use the inquirer.prompt() method to prompt the user for information, such as the project name, description, installation instructions, usage, contribution guidelines, and license: -->
inquirer.prompt([
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'project_name',
    message: 'Enter the project name:'
  },
  ...
]).then(answers => {
  ...
});

<!-- Store the user input in variables, and append them to readmeText in the desired format. For example: -->
let projectName = answers.project_name;
let description = answers.description;
readmeText += `# ${projectName}\n\n`;
readmeText += `${description}\n\n`;

<!-- Repeat the previous step for each piece of information you want to prompt the user for. -->
<!-- Use the fs (file system) module to write the readmeText to a file named README.md: -->
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('README.md', readmeText, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('README generated successfully!');
});

<!-- Save and run your script using node generate_readme.js. The generated README will be saved in the same directory as your script. -->

<!-- Test your script by entering different information each time you run it. -->
